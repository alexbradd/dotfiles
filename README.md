# bred's dotfiles
## Description
This is where I store most of my configuration files. These files have been written
to suit *my* needs and to work in *my* setup, so be careful if you want to eventually 
use them as they maybe won't play nice with yours.

## Installation
To install, copy what config files you want from the `src` folder into the appropriate
place in your home directory.
